# HRV_for_SLEEP_LSTM
 You can download the dataset from: http://www.ofai.at/siesta/.

The aim of this project is to develop a system to monitor SLEEP STAGEs. In order to improve the accuracy rate, I used two kinds of LSTM networks (regression and classification). The regression LSTM is used to follow the trend of the SLEEP STAGEs line, while due to a weakness of the above LSTM to accurately locate and predict the state of sleep, I applied the classification LSTM to assist the monitoring.

If you donwloaded the siesta dataset and the Eindhoven data set referring to this paper: " LSTM knowledge transfer for HRV-based sleep
staging ", please email me kangkangsome@gmail.com . I will update the code and add more features to improve the performance of this model.
